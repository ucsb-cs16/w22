## Exam topics

You are expected to know all the material covered in the class.   More details will be provided as the exam date gets closer.

## Past midterms

* Past exams: You may also refer to all the past exams. Please note that the subject matter of CMPSC 16 has changed over time.   Some questions on these exams may refer to material that was not part of the course this quarter.  The past exams should however provide some information on the types of questions one might expect on a CMPSC 16 exam.

Please also note that I cannot commit to providing answer keys to any of these exams, much less all of them.  However if you bring an attempted solution to office hours, we can look over your solution and give you feedback.

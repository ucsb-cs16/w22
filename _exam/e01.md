## Instructions for the exam 

* This will be an online exam held on Gradescope during our lecture time.
* The exam is open to everything, but to eliminate the possibility of communicating with each other, we will give more problems than the in-person exam in last quarter, which means you won't have time to look up in the textbook for every problem. So you should rely on your own knowledge mostly.
* Please make sure that you all have joined the campuswire, and if you have any questions during the midterm our TAs and I are there to help you.
* There are no makeups for this exam.


## Past exams
You may also refer to all the past exams. Please note that some questions on these exams may refer to labs that you have not completed so far. You will only be asked questions related to the labs you have completed. The past exams should however provide some information on the expected difficulty and approximate format of the exam. Please note that there may be differences in content as well.

Please note that these old exams are provided "as is"; I cannot commit to providing answer keys for any of them, much less all of them.

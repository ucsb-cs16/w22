# Subscribing to the zyBook

* Sign in or create an account at learn.zybooks.com
* Enter zyBook code `UCSBCMPSC16DengWinter2022` and Subscribe
* A subscription is $77. Students may begin subscribing on Dec 20, 2021 and the cutoff to subscribe is Mar 12, 2022. 
* Subscriptions will last until Apr 02, 2022.

# Creating your CoE Account

The discussion sections take place in Phelps 3525.

* For now, if you are bringing your own computer to discussion section, you won't necessarily need a CoE Account.
* But if you are using the lab provided computers, you'll need a CoE account to access these (otherwise you won't get past the password prompt)
* And, eventually, everyone in the course will be required to have and use a CoE account to complete some course assignments.


You can create an account online at <https://accounts.engr.ucsb.edu/create>

If you are enrolled in any CoE course this quarter (including this one), you should be able to create your account immediately.

If you find that you cannot:
* Ask a staff member for help (in person during lab or office hours, or on Campuswire)
* The ECI Help Desk can be reached at help@engineering.ucsb.edu.

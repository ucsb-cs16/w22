By the due date ({{ page.due | date: "%a %m %d %Y at %H:%M"}}), please:
* Complete the first part of Chapter 5 (basic knowledge sections from 5.1 to 5.13, not including the LAB sections).
* This homework includes only the first part to reduce your study burden before the midterm. Several sections have already been covered in our previous lectures.
* After Thursday's lecture (2/10) this page will be updated to include the remaining LAB sections.

If you find that you are stuck on any of the exercises in Chapter 5, please bring your questions about those to the first lecture after the due date, or to office hours or lab (discussion section).

You will be given one addiitonal week to complete whatever you are
stuck on, but don't procrastinate; there will be additional
assignments.  Do your best to keep up and not fall behind.
